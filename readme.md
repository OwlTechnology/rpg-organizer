# RPG Organizer

RPG Organizer is a web application for keeping track of tabletop RPG games, and
performing common actions that Game Masters and players may need while playing,
organizing, or preparing for a tabletop RPG session/campaign.

In addition, the system will have a static section storing all of the OGL
licensed content so that the content can be accessed via Google Home, Facebook
Bots, and other systems, as well as via an API for other developers who want
quick access to that information.

## System Support

The first system we are developing this app for is D&D 5. This is partially due
to the popularity of D&D, and also because D&D's publisher, Wizards of the Coast,
provides what they call an
[Open Game License](http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/SRD-OGL_V1.1.pdf)
for the game, allowing developers
like us to create free systems like this for D&D without paying any royalties
or explicitly licensing the game from Wizards (which we are very thankful for).

We will eventually add support for more systems as we find the time and the legal
ability to add support for those systems. If you have a system you would like to
see supported, open an issue for it and we'll look into it.

We're still working on getting the project off the ground and an alpha ready, so
we won't be ready for new systems for some time.

## Running the Application Locally

If you wish to run this application yourself, it is a standard Laravel app, please
see the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3) for more information.

## Bugs, Feature Requests

If you encounter any bugs with the system, or wish to see some feature
implemented, please open an issue on our GitHub's issue tracker.
